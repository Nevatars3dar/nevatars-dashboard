## 🔄 Updating Data

Dashboard data comes from `assets_data.json` which is generated by the "Sync Registry" tool.

**To update:**
1. In Maya, click **"Sync Registry"**
2. Refresh browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. Updated data appears instantly!

**Note:** Server keeps running - no need to restart it. Just refresh the browser.

## 🌐 Sharing Options

### **Option A: Same Network (Recommended)**

**Requirements:**
- Team computers on same network/WiFi
- Server running on your computer

**URL to share:**
```
http://YOUR_IP:8080/assets_dashboard.html
```

**Example:**
```
http://192.168.1.100:8080/assets_dashboard.html
```

### **Option B: File Server**

If you can't run a web server:

1. Copy these files to a shared network location:
   - `assets_dashboard.html`
   - `assets_data.json`

2. Team opens `assets_dashboard.html` directly from the network drive

**Note:** This works but is less convenient (team needs drive mapping)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **"Error loading data" message**

**Problem:** Dashboard can't find `assets_data.json`

**Solution:**
1. Run "Sync Registry" in Maya first
2. Make sure `assets_data.json` exists in same folder as HTML
3. Refresh browser page

### **"Address already in use" error**

**Problem:** Port 8080 is already taken

**Solution:**
1. Close other applications using port 8080
2. OR edit `start_server.py` and change `PORT = 8080` to `PORT = 8081`

### **Team can't access via Network URL**

**Problem:** Firewall blocking port 8080

**Solution:**
1. Windows Firewall → Allow app through firewall
2. Add Python to allowed apps
3. Enable for Private networks

### **Dashboard loads but no data shows**

**Problem:** Browser cache or old JSON file

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Check `assets_data.json` was generated recently
3. Re-run "Sync Registry" in Maya

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Dashboard is **read-only** - cannot modify data
- Only shows data from `assets_data.json`
- YAML files are the source of truth
- Safe to share within your team/network

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Keep server running** - Team can access anytime without asking you
2. **Pin the URL** - Save it in team chat for easy access
3. **Update regularly** - Run "Sync Registry" after creating/moving assets
4. **Mobile friendly** - Works great on phones/tablets for reviewing assets on the go
